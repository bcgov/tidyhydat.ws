\details{
The \code{username} and \code{password} should be treated carefully and should never be entered directly into an r script or console.
Rather these credentials should be stored in your \code{.Renviron} file. The .Renviron file can edited using \code{file.edit("~/.Renviron")}.
In that file, which is only stored locally and is only available to you, you can assign your \code{username} to WS_USRNM and \code{password}
to WS_PWD and then simply issue \code{token_ws}. See \code{?download_ws} for examples.
